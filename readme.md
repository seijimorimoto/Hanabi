# Hanabi Agent

An agent (HisGranAha) implementing MCTS and using a neural network for predicting policy and state
values in order to replace the rollout phase of MCTS, incrementing the speed of the algorithm and
therefore increasing the percentage of the state space explored in a MCTS simulation.

The agent was built for being able to play in the [Fireworks framework](https://git.fossgalaxy.com/iggi/hanabi)
and it was developed on top of the [starter package](http://hanabi.fosslab.uk/) provided by the
framework itself.
